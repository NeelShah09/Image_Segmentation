# **Image Segmentation**

In digital image processing and computer vision, image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels, also known as image objects). Image segmentation is typically used to locate objects and boundaries (lines, curves, etc.) in images. More precisely, image segmentation is the process of assigning a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain characteristics.

In this project, Semantic Segmentation is performed to identify the road, vehicles, buildings, trees, etc. The architecture used for Image Segmentation is [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597) Architecture and the dataset used to train the model is taken from Kaggle which was created in CARLA Simulator.
